## Introduction
Trained computer vision classifier models reflects our own biases in society. For example, google baseball players and you will get pictures of almost all males. If you train a generative model to draw a person cooking in a home kitchen from Internet pictures, you are more likely to get a woman than a man. On the surface, these results come from unbalanced traning data. But the issue goes deeper than that. In the next few sections, we will discuss dataset leakage and model leakage, which result in biased behaviors of our models, classical approaches to correct biases, and a novel deep learning approach. 

We base our discussion on two academic papers. We will discuss a few classical approaches from Mehrabi et al. We will discuss the adversarial debiasing method from Wang et al. 

## Dataset Leakage and Model Leakage
To investigate the biases of our models, we need to first define two leakages: dataset leakage and model leakage. Dataset leakage measures the predictability of protected information, i.e. gender, from ground truth labels. Model leakage measures the predictability of protected information from model prediction. 

A model is said to be amplifying biases if it exhibits stronger model leakage than dataset leakage.

Now, let's take a closer look at these two leakages.

### Table
Here is an example for creating tables, including alignment syntax.

|             | column 1    |  column 2     |
| :---        |    :----:   |          ---: |
| row1        | Text        | Text          |
| row2        | Text        | Text          |



### Code Block
```
# This is a sample code block
import torch
print (torch.__version__)
```


### Formula
Please use latex to generate formulas, such as:

$$
\tilde{\mathbf{z}}^{(t)}_i = \frac{\alpha \tilde{\mathbf{z}}^{(t-1)}_i + (1-\alpha) \mathbf{z}_i}{1-\alpha^t}
$$

or you can write in-text formula $$y = wx + b$$.
