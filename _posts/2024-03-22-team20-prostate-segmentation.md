## History

Classical approaches to 3D image generation of inner tissues and organs involved
manual delineation/contouring which were incredibly time-consuming, expensive
and had rigid calculations for irregular shapes which led to inaccurate
measurements. Traditional statistical models such as K-Means, SVMs and Random
Forest were just as inaccurate since they depended on handcrafted features and
required significantly more preprocessing.

## Enter Deep Learning

We can think of prostate segmentation as classifying voxels as either part or
not part of a tumor. We then use prior training examples to understand how model
boundaries of prostate in a "noisy advantage". This has a dual advantage of
performing image classification and segmentation simultaneously, reducing
overhead, leading to faster diagnoses. The lowered costs and increased speeds
such methods provide also increases accessibility to prostate cancer detection
methods in emerging economies where medical infrastructure is substandard.

## Models

### ENet

ENet is a fast and compact Encoder-Decoder network. The vanilla ENet model
assumes an input size of $$512 \times 512$$. The initial ENet block has a
convolution operation ($$3 \times 3$$, stride 2), max pooling, then a
concatenation. The convolution has 13 filters, which produces 16 feature maps
after concatenation. Then comes the bottleneck module. Here, convolution is
either regular, dilated or full with $$3 \times 3$$ filters, or a $$5\times5$$
convolution into asymmetric ones. Then using a skip connection, merge back with
element-wise addition. There is also Batch Normalization and PReLU between all
convolutions. The below Figure 1 highlights the overall model architecture.

1. **Feature Map Resolution**: There are two main issues with downsampling
   during image segmentation. Reducing image resolution means the loss of exact
   edges and very strong downsampling will require just as strong upsampling,
   which is costly and inefficient. ENet addresses these concerns by adding the
   feature maps produced by the encoder and saving the indices that were chosen
   in max pooling layers to be later formed as upsampled maps in the decoder.

2. **Early Downsampling**: Processing large input frames is very expensive, and
   this occurs mainly at the lower blocks of the model. ENet's first two blocks
   heavily reduce the input size and use a small amount of feature maps. This
   works since visual information is normally very redundant, so compressing it
   makes operations much more efficient.

3. **Dilated Convolutions**: It is very important for the model to have a wide
   receptive field, so to avoid overly downsampling, dilated convolutions
   replace the main convolutions inside the bottlenecks. They did this for the
   stages that operate on the smallest resolutions. The best accuracy was
   obtained when these convolutions were combined with other bottleneck modules.

4. **Regularization**: Regularization techniques are vital for enhancing the
   performance and generalization capability of UNet, a neural network
   architecture widely used for tasks like image segmentation. Dropout, which
   randomly deactivates units during training, can be applied to convolutional
   layers in both the contracting and expansive paths to discourage
   over-reliance on specific features. Weight decay, or L2 regularization,
   penalizes large weights in the network's parameters, promoting simpler models
   and preventing overfitting. Data augmentation, involving transformations like
   rotation and flipping, diversifies the training data, aiding in better
   generalization. Batch normalization normalizes layer activations,
   accelerating training and acting as a form of regularization by reducing
   internal covariate shift. Finally, early stopping halts training when
   validation loss starts increasing, preventing overfitting and encouraging the
   model to learn more generalizable patterns. These techniques, either
   individually or combined, play a crucial role in optimizing the performance
   and robustness of UNet models for various applications. In the original ENet
   paper, spacial dropout showed the best results in order to prevent
   overfitting of the pixel-wise datasets, which tend to be quite small [2].

ENet's main advantage is its speed. It can achieve surprisingly high accuracy
while using computational resources very sparingly and working very quickly.
This is why it was initially developed for real-time applications, such as self
driving cars. It was later adapted to other uses, such as medical image
segmentation, which is of use to us when detecting prostate cancer.

### UNet

UNet was developed specifically for biological image segmentation. Now, UNet's
architecture is distinctive with distinct dual pathways: the contracting and
expansive paths. The contracting path, comprising encoder layers, captures
context and diminishes input spatial resolution. Conversely, the expansive path,
housing decoder layers, deciphers encoded data using skip connections from the
contracting path to produce a segmentation map.

In the contracting path, relevant features are discerned from the input image.
Encoder layers execute convolutions, reducing spatial resolution while deepening
feature maps to abstract representations. This process mirrors feedforward
layers in conventional CNNs. Conversely, the expansive path decodes encoded
data, retaining input spatial resolution. Decoder layers upsample feature maps
and perform convolutions, aided by skip connections to restore spatial
information lost during contraction, facilitating more precise feature
localization.

Distinct features of UNet:

1. $$3 \times 3$$ convolutions -> $$5 \times 5$$ convolutions: consider more
   information in each step
2. 0 padding the input: ensure size of output feature maps = size of input
3. Input size of $$512 \times 512$$
4. 32 filters in first layer of encoder -> produces 32 feature maps:
   fine-grained details in image captured from beginning
5. Doubled the feature maps after each max pooling layer, which halves
   dimensions of the map itself, clamping at 256 feature maps (each feature map
   has dimensions of $$64 \times 64$$ here): focus on most prominent/distinct
   features and capture more abstract representation Normalization of the scale
   of data to prevent large weights: prevents overfitting + faster convergence

#### Training Methodology

UNet features 5-fold cross validation to prevent overfitting (68 in train set,
17 in test). It uses the Tversky loss function, which features an adapted
version of the Dice Score Coefficient (DSC) to account for various data
imbalance. In the original paper, experiments found that 0.00001 was the most
optimal learning rate while the constants $$\alpha = 0.3$$, $$\beta = 0.7$$, $$N
= 8$$ were used for Tversky Loss.

### Comparison

ENet and UNet are both widely used architectures for image segmentation, each
with its own strengths and characteristics. ENet, known for its efficiency and
lightweight design, features a simple encoder-decoder structure with skip
connections, making it suitable for real-time applications on
resource-constrained devices. In contrast, UNet is a more complex architecture
specifically designed to capture both local and global features effectively,
particularly in biomedical image segmentation tasks like prostate segmentation.

When comparing the two models, ENet typically has fewer trainable parameters and
a smaller size on disk compared to UNet, indicating a simpler architecture that
requires less storage space. Furthermore, ENet demonstrates significantly lower
inference times on both CPU and GPU, making it highly efficient for processing
images in real-time scenarios. These advantages make ENet an attractive option
for tasks where computational efficiency is paramount.

| Model Name | Trainable Parameters | Non-Trainable Parameters | Size on Disk | Inference Time/Dataset (CPU) | Inference Time/Dataset (GPU) |
| :--------- | :------------------: | :----------------------: | :----------: | :--------------------------: | ---------------------------: |
| ENet       |       362,992        |          8,352           |    5.8 MB    |            6.17 s            |                       1.07 s |
| UNet       |      5,403,874       |            0             |   65.0 MB    |           42.02 s            |                       1.57 s |

However, for prostate image segmentation, where precise delineation of
structures is crucial, UNet may be preferred despite its higher computational
cost. UNet's deeper layers and skip connections enable it to capture fine
details and contextual information more effectively, leading to better
segmentation accuracy. In tasks like medical image segmentation, where accuracy
is paramount, the improved performance of UNet outweighs its higher
computational demands.

In summary, while ENet offers superior efficiency and speed, UNet's architecture
is better suited for complex segmentation tasks like prostate image
segmentation, where achieving high accuracy and detail preservation is
essential, even at the cost of increased computational resources.

## Conclusion

We believe UNet is the best model for prostate segmentation. While it might
carry an overhead in processing times and a much larger GPU footprint making it
significantly more expensive to train and deploy, we believe the fact that it
has a significantly higher number of trainable parameters make it perfect for
complex use cases, which are critical in detecting early stage prostate cancer.
This also means that the number of false positive disease diagnosis will fall
significantly along with the far more dangerous false negatives.
